This repository contains a set of analyses using supervised and unsupervised machine learning to process biological data

CAP (CANONICAL ANALYSIS OF PRINCIPAL COORDINATES): a method that allows a constrained ordination of species abundance data, based on a particular dissimilarity measure. # performed with abundance_df.csv file # 

UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Grouping Method with Arithmetic-mean): one of the most common Hierarchical clustering algorithms used in computational biology. It defines the dissimilarity between clusters as their average dissimilarity (hence its name).
